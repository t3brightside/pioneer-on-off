## Pioneer ON/OFF

This one sends wake up pulse to Pioneer amplifier that has "Control" input to receive wake up calls from other, remote controlled, Pioneer components.

 ### How it works
 Arduino sends the pulse and Python script is there to do the switching. I'm using it to check if there's music playing on ALSA to switch the amp on and off again if it's been on idle for a  while.

 It's just a little hack :)
